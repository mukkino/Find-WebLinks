# DISCLAIMER
# Before diving into the code, a small reality check.
# You may find that my coding style, architecture choices, naming conventions,
# error handling, formatting, comments, lack of comments, or any number of other
# technical or aesthetic decisions do not align with your refined engineering
# sensibilities or personal definition of perfection. That's fine.
# This project exists because I built it for myself, to solve problems I
# personally had. I'm simply making it available in case someone else finds it
# useful.
# If you like it, use it. If you don't like it, don't use it. If you think you
# can do better, by all means go ahead and write your own version.
# What you should not do is show up with unsolicited lectures, passive-aggressive
# nitpicking, or clever little remarks about how you would have done things
# differently. Those contributions add exactly zero value.
# So here is the simple rule:
# Use it if it helps you. Ignore it if it doesn't. And if your main intention is
# to complain, critique for sport, or showcase your superior taste -- please take
# that energy somewhere else.
# That said, if you actually want to help in a constructive way -- improvements,
# fixes, ideas, pull requests, or thoughtful discussion -- then you're absolutely
# welcome. I'm always happy to collaborate with people who bring solutions
# instead of attitude.
# Thank you, and enjoy the code.
